## Overview

In learning about what tech/startups are doing in their engineering departments, it was often pretty awesome to look at their 'tech blogs' that they have setup. Often they'd talk about the cutting edge stuff they would be doing.

With that I wanted to aggregate them into a nice site, to browse these posts to their blogs. Thus this little side project started: Engineering Blogs. It started as just a list in the readme, but then I wanted to build a website around it.

## Todo

- Host site on my digital ocean acct when ready
- ~~Use Hapi to provide backend API (blogs/all, blogs/{blogId}, etc)~~
- ~~annotate with swagger-ui~~
- ~~Use efficient rss parser~~
- ~~Display nicely in chrono order~~
- Break out API better(blogs/{blogId}, blogs/{blogId}/findFeed)
- Grab rss feeds on interval
- Caching in backend
- MongoDB usage for backend
- Paging in UI
- Suggest a site feature
- Parse text of posts for automatic categorization. (opportunity to try some more Machine Learning algorithms here)
